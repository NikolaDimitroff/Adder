# Algorithms
This is an incomplete list of the algorithms to be implemented in **Adder**. Most of them are taken straight from [Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach][aima] (the book, not the code repo!) and the course *Nonclassical logics for AI* taught @ FMI, Sofia University by prof. Dimitar Vakarelov
## Classical search
* BFS
* DFS
* Depth-limited search
* Iterative-deepening search
* Bidirectional search
* A*
* MBA*

## Local search
* Hill climbing
* Local beam
* Simulated annealing
* Genetic algorithms
* AND-OR search trees

## Adversarial
* Minmax
* Alpha-beta prunning

## Propositional logic
* Model checking
* Theorem proving using resolution / Modus Ponens
* Theorem proving in definitive clauses using forward / backward checking

## Nonclassical logic
* TBA

## Agents
* Reflex agent
* Knowledge-based agent
* Agents for n-queens, tic-tac-toe, Wumpus world
