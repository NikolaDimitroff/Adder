# Adder
### An AI library in Python
---------
## Purpose
Adder is meant to be a developer-friendly and easy-to-learn library that provides implementations of many AI algorithms (and a few other that ease working with graphs and trees in general). For a complete list of the algorithms and some pseudocode, check out the *[algorithms page][algos]*.

## Development log
Here's a short list of thingies that should be implemented before the 2nd of June (**PPL FROM FMI.PY-BG.NET LOOK HERE**):

* At least 5 moderately sized graphs for testing purposes
* At least 2 instances of the other problems used for testing (such as n-queens)
* Implementation and tests of Graphs, Digraphs and utilities for loading graphs from files / strings
* Implementation and tests of the classical search algorithms: 
 * Graph Traversal (breadth-first, depth-first)
 * BFS
 * DFS
 * Depth-limited search
 * Iterative deepening DFS
 * Bidirectional search
 * A Star (perhaps some of its variations such as MBA*)
* Implementation and tests of some advanced algorithms: 
 * Simulated Annealing
 * Hill Climbing
 * Local beam
 * Genetics
* Implementation and tests of theorem proving and model checking for classical propositonal logic for decision making
* [if time is enough] Implementation and tests of several utilities that may come in handy - reachability relation, space partitioning
* [if time is enough] Documentation
